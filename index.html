            <h2>About Rhalza</h2>
            <p>   Hi, I'm Rhalza (Shane), a 28-year-old developer, music artist, and digital artist. This page is a casual showcase of some of my projects.</p>
            <p>   In web development, one of my ongoing projects is a <a href="3d.html">3D sandbox</a>. I've designed it to be fully interactive in the browser, and while it runs on any device, it's definitely a better experience on a desktop. I've also created a <a href="chess.html">chess game with a bot</a>, which you can play against directly on its own page. I am also actively working on an Integrated Developer Environment (IDE), called RyxIDE. Once I manage to finish a stable and functional version of it, then I will make it public.</p>
            <p>   Besides web development, I also enjoy <a href="music.html">making music</a> and creating digital art. I find that working on different kinds of projects keeps my creativity fresh across all of them. Everything you'll find here is a result of that process.</p>
            <p>   What you take away from my work is entirely up to you. I simply enjoy building things and putting them out there for others to see and experience.</p>
